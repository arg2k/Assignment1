1) Convert Hexadecimal - 24F to Binary .

Ans:- 

In numeral system, we know hexadecimal is base-16 and binary is base-2. To convert hexadecimal 24F to binary, we follow these steps:

To do this, first convert hexadecimal into decimal, then the resulting decimal into binary - 

1.Start from one's place in hexadecimal : multiply ones place with 16^0, tens place with 16^1, hundreds place with 16^2 and so on from right to left
2.Add all the products we got from step 1 to get the decimal equivalent of given hexadecimal value.
3.Then, divide decimal value we got from step-2 by 2 keeping notice of the quotient and the remainder.
4.Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until you get a quotient of zero.
5.Then just write out the remainders in the reverse order to get binary equivalent of decimal number.

By using above steps if we convert 24F into decimal we get 591.

Now, we have to convert 591 to binary

591 / 2 = 295 with remainder 1
295 / 2 = 147 with remainder 1
147 / 2 = 73 with remainder 1
73 / 2 = 36 with remainder 1
36 / 2 = 18 with remainder 0
18 / 2 = 9 with remainder 0
9 / 2 = 4 with remainder 1
4 / 2 = 2 with remainder 0
2 / 2 = 1 with remainder 0
1 / 2 = 0 with remainder 1

Then just write down the remainders in the reverse order to get the answer, The hexadecimal number 24F converted to binary is therefore equal to : 1001001111
